## Data

As the data flows past my red robes into my visual receptors it all becomes data. 
Pure data, going through my still fleshy brain, it converts from visuals to data. Pure connections from neuron to neuron.

Once I try to recall it, it feels more than is. The data flies through my brain like binary, colours and visuals at the same time.
My biology comes apparent, as I corrupt the data by living, recalling impure data each time I think.

Does the machine spirit think the same, of course they are better. But the machine spirit flows in us all, so we must be the same on some sort of level.

### Visual Data

As I recall previous data back into my mind it comes vague, as numbers, feelings, colours.
 Some of my fellow priest they see clear as day what they think of. I do feel what I think of, when I think of a cog I do "see" it to a certain extent.
