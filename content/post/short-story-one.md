## Chapter one

As the drop-ship approached the destination, he noticed the faces of his fellow mechanical warriors. He tried to look past their masks to try and see any thoughts lurking behind those lidless eyes. "T-5 minutes to destination" the speaker informed me.
Incense was being lit and he among his comrades started muttering prayers to the machine god.
As he felt the prayer beads flowing through his hands he wondered if his comrades also remembered their first days…
Laying in a vat, falling in and out of consciousness, waiting an endless line of ones alike to him, standing in front one of the priests and being led to their barracks.
Fragmented memories of hard labour and hardship until one day a priest took him away to the Skitarii mustering ground drifted in his mind.
Each mission he remembered less and less."T-2 minutes", chants come out of the speaker, it tells of a Skitarii that walks the same route everyday on patrol. He follows his protocol no matter how long and tedious the patrol becomes. Then one day an intruder tries to steal data. And because of the zealous following of protocol the Skitarri catches the intruder and kills him. This chant reminds the Skitarri how important patrols are.
"T-30 seconds to drop off. Set protector imperative".
The doors flung open, and he ran out into the void among the rest of his squad.

After the perimeter around the ship was set and the squad had embarked, the ship quickly left. "No enemy signatures detected" he heard from within his mask.
"transferred patrol route", his squad leader said. A rush of data entered his mind as he saw a visual in front of his eyes.
It showed the asteroid they are currently on and the jumps they have to execute to get to smaller asteroids.
As he zoomed out he could see the section of the asteroid field they had to patrol this day. The alpha took the lead heading to the edge of the asteroid while scanning for enemies.
He jumped with the help of a small backpack and foot boosters. He floated for a short while before landing on the next asteroid.

They marched on in silence, their purple robes accumulated dust and their arms got dented by tiny fragments of the asteroids littering the space.
Once in a while a blip would come up on his HUD but after further scanning the signal would have disappeared. “Radioactive interference” he thought, remembering the training with the tech priest. These asteroid fields were littered with radiation. The closer you are to the core - the more radioactive it gets, but also - the more artefacts are there to find. With the use of the artefacts the tech priest would come close to the Machine God, to the endless pursuit of knowledge.

A distress call came in of another squad. "Set retrieval imperative delta"  the Alpha commanded as he slung the radium carbine rifle onto his shoulder.
They hopped two rocks further and the sensors picked up a xenos machine spirit, his vision zooms in on the target. The energy readings went up on his HUD as a laser missed his fellow Skitarius.
They moved in shooting their radium shots, the metal of the turrets dented and the xenos signals got weaker. "It seems like the xenos machine spirit does not like the radiation" the Skitarri commented to his comrades.

A few more shots and the lasers as well as the signal started to dissipate. He could sense a binaric cycle going from the Alpha to the tech priest, informing them that the alien machine spirits woke up.
"What would have made them wake up?" he asked the Skitarii next to him."The xenos work in mysterious ways, do not seek to understand it. The ninth law says 'the xenos mechanism is a perversion of the True Path'"

The Skitarii slowed down and moved forwards in silence. They arrived at the destroyed turret to discover a cloak covered in blood laying next to it.
It belonged to one of the rangers lost two days ago. He remembered seeing him in the mess hall. They had never talked, but he knew his assigned number.
He crouched down next to the ranger and prayed to the machine god. Skitarius alpha transferred the location of the ranger and turret to the tech priest.
"Does he even care for the lost human life?" he thought. "Have you ever met him" he says to his fellow Skitarii, "He served the machine god, and fulfilled his purpose,
that is all that is important" they respond.

He wondered if he would end up like them. Whenever he notices the Machine Spirit it seems to feel alive and full of emotions. More emotions than his comrades.
The troop starts moving again, and they report their finding. "The Serbery's will handle cleanup" the Alpha says. After a long patrol they picked up more traces of radiation,
but all were discovered to be dead ends.

When they got back to the rendezvous he saw the ship coming in. A great metallic ship with purple scripture covering the side, hard angles and the logo of the forge world in bronze on the prow.
After it landed, they boarded the ship and connected up to the Machine Spirit. They all closed their eyes and suddenly felt data enter and exit their minds, while their nostrils were filled with the smell of incense.
All data recorded during the patrol was sent off to the tech priest in command. He wondered if the tech priest heard the conversations, scared of thinking what might happen to him when he iwoudl be back at the command ship.

As the lander approaches the massive Mechanicus vessel, the Skitarii can see the ship looming in the distance. The ship is a monolithic imposing structure, its hull adorned with purple script and symbols of the Machine God.
The ship's engines hummed with power as it slowly rotated, its guns ready to defend against any threat.

The lander docked with the ship, and the Skitarii disembarked and walked through the corridors. The ship's Machine Spirit is ever-present, a constant hum of data and power flowing through the entire structure.
The Skitarii felled the machine spirit's ever-presence in every aspect of the ship, from the lighting to the temperature.

Once they had landed they moved out and marched to the barracks. The halls were cold and full of fog, off in the distance the hammering of pistons and a faint chant from the temples could be heard.
The Alpha called him over "Sk-123, I have scanned the conversation you had on patrol and concluded that your emotional thoughts will endanger the missions.
Go to the temple and talk to the priests, you must keep following the protocols from the machine god". He walks away to clean his armour.
SK-123 cleans and purifies his armour, then takes his of,f mask hangs it up next to his bunk and dawns his hood.
