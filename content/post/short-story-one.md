## Chapter one

As the dropship approached the destination he noticed the faces of his fellow mechanical warriors he tried to look past they masks,
To try and see any thoughts lurking behind those lidless eyes. "T-5 minutes till destination" the speaker beyond.
Incense was being lit and he among his comrades started muttering prayers to the machine god. 
As he felt the prayer beads flowed through his hands he wondered if his comrades also remembered their first days,
Laying in a vat falling in and out of consciousness, wandering down a line, standing in front one of the priests and being led to their barracks.
Fragments of hard labour and hardship until one day a priest took him away to the Skitarii mustering ground.
Each mission he remembers less and less. "T-30 seconds till drop off. Set protector imperative".
The doors flung open, and he ran out into the void among the rest of his squad.

After the perimeter around the ship was set and the squad had embarked the ship quickly left. "No enemy signatures detected" he heard from within his mask.
"transferred patrol route", his squad leader spoke. A rush of data entered his mind he saw a visual in front og his eyes,
showing the asteroid they are currently on and the jumps they have to make to get to other smaller asteroids. 
As he zoomed out he could see the section of th astride field they had to patrol this day. The alpha took the lead heading to the edge of this asteroid while scanning for enemies.
As he approached the edge he jumped with the help of a small backpack and feet boosters. He floated for a short while until landing on the next asteroid.

They marched on in silence, their purple robes being covered in dust and their arms being dented by tiny fragments of the asteroids littering the sky.
Once every while a blip came up on his HUD but after further scanning the signal disappeared. Radioactive interference the priest had told them in their trainings.
These asteroid fields were littered with radiation, but the deeper you go there are teh artifacts. The machines the priests are trying to get.
To get closer to the machine god, to continue the endless pursuit of knowledge.

In the distance a came in. A distress call of another squad. "Set retrieval imperative delta" said the alpha as he slung his rifle onto his shoulder. 
[ A old non necron xenos turred is there, battle, find signal, dead skitarri, has feeligns, have tiny convo]
