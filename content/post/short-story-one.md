## Chapter one

As the drop-ship approached the destination he noticed the faces of his fellow mechanical warriors he tried to look past they masks,
To try and see any thoughts lurking behind those lidless eyes. "T-5 minutes till destination" the speaker beyond.
Incense was being lit and he among his comrades started muttering prayers to the machine god.
As he felt the prayer beads flowed through his hands he wondered if his comrades also remembered their first days,
Laying in a vat falling in and out of consciousness, wandering down a line, standing in front one of the priests and being led to their barracks.
Fragments of hard labour and hardship until one day a priest took him away to the Skitarii mustering ground.
Each mission he remembers less and less."T-2 minutes" Chants come out of the speakers, it speaks of a Skitarii that walks the same route everyday on patrol.
His protocols keep being followed religiously. One day the Skitarii sees an enemy coming in to steal data and kills him. This chant reminds them how important patrols are.
"T-30 seconds till drop off. Set protector imperative".
The doors flung open, and he ran out into the void among the rest of his squad.

After the perimeter around the ship was set and the squad had embarked the ship quickly left. "No enemy signatures detected" he heard from within his mask.
"transferred patrol route", his squad leader spoke. A rush of data entered his mind he saw a visual in front og his eyes,
showing the asteroid they are currently on and the jumps they have to make to get to other smaller asteroids.
As he zoomed out he could see the section of th astride field they had to patrol this day. The alpha took the lead heading to the edge of this asteroid while scanning for enemies.
As he approached the edge he jumped with the help of a small backpack and feet boosters. He floated for a short while until landing on the next asteroid.

They marched on in silence, their purple robes being covered in dust and their arms being dented by tiny fragments of the asteroids littering the sky.
Once every while a blip came up on his HUD but after further scanning the signal disappeared. Radioactive interference the priest had told them in their trainings.
These asteroid fields were littered with radiation, but the deeper you go there are teh artifacts. The machines the priests are trying to get.
To get closer to the machine god, to continue the endless pursuit of knowledge.

In the distance a came in. A distress call of another squad. "Set retrieval imperative delta" said the alpha as he slung his rifle onto his shoulder.
They hop two rocks further and the sensors pick up a xenos machine spirit, his vision zoom's in on the target. He sees the energie readings go up and a laser just misses his fellow Skitarius.
The move in shooting their radium shots, the metal of the turrets dents and the signals get weaker. "It seems like the xenos machine spirit does not like the radiation".

A few more shots and the lasers as well as the signal started to dissipate. The Skitarii slowed down and moved forwards. When arriving at the destroyed turret there was a cloak covered in blood laying next to it.
It was one of the lost rangers from two days ago. He remembered seeing him in the mess hall, They had never talked, but he knew his assigned number.
He crouches down next to the ranger and prays to the machine god. Skitarius alpha transfers the location of the ranger and turret to the tech priest.
"Does he even care for the lost human live" he thought. "Did you ever meet him" he says to his fellow Skitarii, "He served the machine god, and fulfilled his purpose",
"That is all that is important" they respond.

He wondered if he would ens up like them, whenever he feels the machine spirit it feel alive and full of emotions. More emotions than his comrades.
The troop starts moving again, and they report their finding. "The Serbery's will handle cleanup" the alpha says. After walking for a while they pick up some more traces of radiation,
but they are all dead ends.

When they are back at the rendezvous he sees the ship coming in, A great metallic ship with purple scripture all over the side, hard angles and the logo of the force world in bronze on the prow.
After it landed they boarded the ship and connected up to the machine spirit of the lander, they closed their eyes suddenly they felt data enter and exit his mind, his nostrils being filled with the smell of incense.
All data that was recorded during that patrol was send of to their tech priest. He wonders if the tech priest will hear the conversation, scared of thinking what might happen to him back at their ship.

As the lander approaches the massive AdMech vessel, the Skitari can see the ship looming in the distance. The ship is a monolithic, imposing structure, its hull adorned with purple script and the symbol of the Machine God.
The ship's engines hum with power as it slowly rotates, its guns ready to defend against any threat.

The lander docks with the ship, and the Skitari disembark and walk through the ship's corridors. The ship's machine spirit is ever-present, a constant hum of data and power flowing through the ship.
The Skitari can feel the machine spirit's presence in every aspect of the ship, from the lighting to the temperature.

Once they land they move out and march to the barracks. The halls are cold and full of steam, off in the distance you can hear the hammering of pistons and a faint chant from the temples.
The alpha call's him over "Sk-123, I have scanned the conversation we had on training and concluded that your emotional way of thinking might hurt the missions.
Go to the temple and talk to the priests, you must keep following the protocols from the machine god". He walks away to clean his armour. SK-123 purifies his armour and head to the temple.

[//]: # (After the flight back all the data got transferred from the troops to the tech priest.)
[//]: # (All visual data as wel as sensor readings. He just hopes the tech-priest won't listen to his conversation and can't read his thoughts about the fallen ranger.)
