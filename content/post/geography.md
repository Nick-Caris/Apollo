Forge world Malleaton is located in the REDACTED system. This used to be a vibrant system with mining words, population centres and worlds wholly dedicated to research.
After the events of REDACTED the system looks wholly different.

The main forge world "planet" Maelleaton has been broken up into four pieces. Three main asteroids all connected with the frozen core, the frozen core "Maelleaton Alpha"  is mostly used for mining and has some temples recognising the past of the system.
"Mealleaton factorum" is the assembly asteroids. The empty dusty black sand plains make it verse suitable for production. It makes most of the products are made, from weaponry, mining equipment to daily products used by the forewords and surrounding systems. There is also "Temple rock", this is a barren black waste with temple structures dotting the exterior of the planet and diving deep down in the asteroid.
The third and final part of the planet is called "Cool nercon name", the rocky wastes are not suitable for the big factor halls that inhabit one of the outer asteroids. Here there are towers that pierce the sky, filled with tech priests running around and studying all forms of life and tech.
